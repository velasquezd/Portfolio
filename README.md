# Professional Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio — a mix of projects.

Some of it’s personal, some collaborative, and all of it reflects my interest in building and creating across different mediums. Hoping to keep adding more as I go — thanks for checking it out.


## Tech Stack

**Technologies Used:** Html, Css

Hoping to add 3D models using Three.js and start incorporating front-end frameworks to make things more responsive and interactive. Stay tuned for future updates — more cool stuff coming soon!
