# Professional Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio — a mix of projects from marketing, 3D modeling, and web development. I use this space to share what I’ve worked on, what I’m learning, and where I’m trying to grow.

Some of it’s personal, some collaborative, and all of it reflects my interest in building and creating across different mediums. Hoping to keep adding more as I go — thanks for checking it out.


## Tech Stack

**Technologies Used:** Html, Css, Java

Hoping to add 3D models using Three.js and start incorporating front-end frameworks to make things more responsive and interactive. Stay tuned for future updates — more cool stuff coming soon!
